      Introduction to CSS
    </h2>
    <p>
      CSS (Cascading Styles Sheet) is the code that styles a webpage. For
      example decorating the background with a certain color or image.
    </p>
    <h3>
      So let's talk a bit more about CSS
    </h3>
    <p>
      Like HTML, CSS and neither is it a programming language. It is a
      <strong>style sheet.</strong><br />It is basically used to style HTML
      elements.

      Anatomy of a CSS Ruleset

    <p>
      The above structure is called a <strong>Ruleset. </strong>Though it is
      mostly referred to as just <em>rule</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      the following are the main parts of a CSS ruleset:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Selector:</strong> This is the HTML element name at the start of
        the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example,
        "<em>p</em>" elements)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Declaration:</strong>This is a single rule like
        <em>color: red;.</em> It specifies which of the element's properties you
        want to style.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Properties:</strong>These are ways in which you can style an HTML
        element. (In this example, color is a property of the
        <em>"p"</em> elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to
        affect in the rule.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Property value:</strong>To the right of the property—after the
        colon—there is the property value. This chooses one out of many possible
        appearances for a given property. (For example, there are many color
        values in addition to red.)
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>
      Selecting multiple elements
    </h2>
    <p>
      You can also select multiple elements and apply a single ruleset to all of
      them. Separate multiple selectors by commas. For example;
    </p>
    <img
      src="https://cdn.glitch.me/32c322af-5d89-40ac-bef2-6141a7131558%2Fthumbnails%2FScreenshot%202021-11-28%20at%2018-17-00%20CSS%20basics%20-%20Learn%20web%20development%20MDN.png?1638112806694"

    <h2>
      Summary
    </h2>
    <p>
      Basically CSS is used to do the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>style text</li>
      <li>change backgrond color etc</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
      Wrapping Up
    </h2>
    <p>
      There is a lot more to CSS than this. This is just a simple glimpse into
      the world of CSS.<br/>This web page is a summary based on
