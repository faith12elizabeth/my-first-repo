      The above structure is called a <strong>Ruleset. </strong>Though it is
      mostly referred to as just <em>rule</em>
    </p>
    <p>
    the following are the main parts of a CSS ruleset:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <l1>
        This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example, <p> elements)
      </l1>
    </ol>
  </body>
